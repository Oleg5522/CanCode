# Functions Part 2

# With documentation and type hinting (optional)


'''
Exercise
Write a function called center that returns either the mean or median of a list of numbers.
This function should take two parameters: A list of numbers, and an optional parameter called use_median which should default to False.
If use_median is False, return the mean of the list.
If use_median is True, return the median of the list.
Test your function by calling it with different arguments.

'''No documentation or type hinting'''

#def center()

test_list1 = [1,2,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
test_list2 = [3,6,7,9,10,11,2]




# '''Documentation, type hinting, shorthand if-then-else'''

test_list1 = [1,2,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
test_list2 = [3,6,7,9,10,11,2]






# Returning multiple values

#     for letter in word:

#             vowels += letter
#         elif letter in 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz':

Exercise
Write a Python function called get_stats that takes in a list of numbers and returns the following three values: The mean, the median, and the mode of the list.
Call the function on a list, and print each statistic on a separate line.
my_list = [1,2,4,5,5]
Output:
Mean: 3.4
Median: 4
Mode: 5
'''

my_list = [1,2,4,5,5]
def get_stats():
    mean = statistics.mean(my_list)
    median = statistics.median(my_list)
    mode = statistics.mode(my_list)
    print(mean)
    print(median)
    print(mode)
    #return f'Mean: {mean}'

#print(get_stats(my_list))
#     x = 'fun'

'''
A lambda is a small anonymous function. It can take any number of arguments, but it can only have one expression, which is returned.
Syntax: lambda arguments : expression
'''

# Function to add two numbers
def add_two(x,y):
    return(x+y)
print(add_two(5,7))
lambda x,y: x+y

add_2 = lambda x,y: x+y
print(add_2(4,6))


# Written as a Lambda




# Write the following functions as Lambdas

def greeting(fname):
    print(f'Hello, {fname}')

greet = lambda z: print(f'Hello, {z}') 
print(greet('Oleg'))



def double_me(num):
    return num + num

double_me = lambda x: float(x+x)
print(double_me(20))
print(double_me(4.5))

'''
Exercise
Write a lambda that computes the n-th power of a number, given two arguments, num and n.
Now, write a function that is equivalent to the lambda.

''' Higher Order Functions
These are functions that may accept a function as an argument or return a function as its output. In Python, reduce(), map() and filter() are some of the most important higher-order functions. When combined with simpler functions, they can be used to execute complex operations.

filter - The filter() method filters the given sequence with the help of a function that tests each element in the sequence to be true or not. 

map - returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)

'''
# Let's use the filter function to find the even numbers in a list



my_list = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

# Triple Me! Triple the numbers in this lsit

triple_me = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6]

# Lambda with sort

            {"name":"Joe","grade":65},

Assignment 6
Write a simple function that returns a person's net worth. Here are your requirements:
Docstring which includes what function does and information on your parameters (brief)
Function name - net_worth
parameters - assets, liabilities
Must contain type hinting for the parameters as well as what the function will be returning
Call the function in a print statement with needed arguments
