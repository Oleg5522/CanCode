                <h2>A turning point in my working life</h2>
                <p>I dreamed of having my own home. The ratio of the cost of the apartment to my salary was such that it would take me 100
                     years to buy it. To do this, I needed to find a good job. And preferably in another country, because in my country a
                      good job can only be found by nepotism. I never had influential relatives, so my chances of finding a prestigious job
                       tended to zero.
                    And only chance helped me. I went to all the interviews in a row. When I came to one of them, one woman-director really 
                    liked me, whose husband was a powerfull government official.
                    She helped me get into audit. Having got into audit, I came to check enterprises owned by a local deputy.
                    A couple of years later, a former prisoner became the President of my country and many oligarchs  started to run away from the country, transferring their capital as far as possible. One of them turned out to be my acquaintance.
                    He offered me to head the accounting department in a new African project. So I found myself in Africa as the CFO of a multinational corporation built on the foundations of former steel companies owned by civil servants and parliamentary staff I knew.
