                <h2>Boring beginning of my professional life</h2>
                <p>In the first years of my accounting life, I was so disappointed that I began to regret that I had received an education as an economist.
                    It turned out that this was quite a difficult job. Our tax legislation changed every month. Directors did not want to pay a large salary. I had to work longer hours, and no one paid anything extra for overtime. When the tax inspectorate came to check, the inspector wrote out a fine in any case, and some directors forced the chief accountant to cover part of the fines. I hated accounting. Nevertheless, I was used to always being the best. And, even despite my dislike for my profession, I took part in a competition dedicated to the legalization of Accountant's Day. As a result, I became the winner in the nomination "Mr. Accountant" and my photo with part of the interview were published in the newspaper "Taxes and Accounting".
                    The next day I bragged to my director, but instead of the expected bonus or at least praise, I saw indifference.
                    I didn't know where to go from accounting, because there was unemployment in almost all industries.
                    I completed programming courses in an accounting program, but this only added $50 to my monthly salary.
